# Lesson development is halted
Please note that the escience center halted development of this machine learning lesson. In the end we realised that [scikit-learns' lesson material](https://inria.github.io/scikit-learn-mooc/) meets our requirements for teaching machine learning to researchers and research software engineers. If you are interested in further developing this lesson, please raise an issue!

# Applying machine learning to research with Python
In this lesson you will learn how to apply machine learning to research problems.
You will learn how to prepare your data for machine learning, 
how to train classification and regression algorithms in a few lines of code with scikit-learn,
and how to evaluate the performance of your machine learning models.

## Target audience
This lesson is targeted to (academic) researchers that already know a bit of Python programming
and want to apply machine learning to their data.

This lesson uses [The Carpentries Workbench][https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/].
