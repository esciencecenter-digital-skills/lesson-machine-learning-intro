# Applying machine learning to research with Python
In this lesson you will learn how to apply machine learning to research problems.
You will learn how to prepare your data for machine learning, 
how to train classification and regression algorithms in a few lines of code with scikit-learn,
and how to evaluate the performance of your machine learning models.

## Target audience
This lesson is targeted to (academic) researchers that already know a bit of Python programming
and want to apply machine learning to their data.

This lesson uses [The Carpentries Workbench][https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/].
